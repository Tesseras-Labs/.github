Tesseras Labs S.A.  
Panama City, Republic of Panama

Tesseras Labs S.A. is a Panama based technology company building infrastructure for compliant real world asset tokenization and market access.

This document defines what the corporation builds, who it serves, and the principles that govern its products.

## What We Build

Tesseras Labs builds RWADEX.ai, a platform suite for:

- Issuing compliant real world asset tokens
- Managing issuer operations and policy workflows
- Enabling compliant trading, discovery, and liquidity access
- Providing operational tooling for market participants

We build infrastructure. We do not operate funds, provide investment advice, or act as a broker dealer.

## Who We Serve

We serve three primary stakeholders:

### Issuers
Organizations that need to structure, launch, and operate compliant tokenized assets.

### Investors and Market Participants
Individuals and institutions seeking compliant access, portfolio visibility, and trading paths for eligible RWA related tokens.

### Liquidity and Execution Partners
Entities that provide liquidity, routing, and execution infrastructure for compliant digital asset markets.

If a product decision does not materially improve one of these groups, it should be reconsidered.

## Architectural Posture

We operate under a multi token market model.

- Ownership tokens encode rights and enforce transfer policies.
- Market tokens and routing layers support liquidity, price discovery, and interoperability.
- Systems must preserve compliance constraints across all layers.

Interoperability across ecosystems, including EVM and NEAR based environments, is supported where it strengthens liquidity and access without compromising regulatory posture.

## Compliance Position

Compliance is foundational to our platform architecture.

We design systems that:

- Enforce eligibility and transfer constraints at the token and application layers
- Preserve auditability and traceability of state changes
- Support jurisdiction aware deployment patterns

Tesseras Labs S.A. does not make securities offerings directly and does not provide investment advice.

Certain offerings facilitated through the platform may not be available to specific jurisdictions, including U.S. retail investors, depending on regulatory requirements.

## Custody and Risk Philosophy

Self custody is the default assumption.

We favor architectures that:

- Minimize custodial exposure
- Support institutional governance controls
- Reduce counterparty risk

## Operating Principles

- Long term durability over short term growth tactics
- Infrastructure before marketing
- Institutional clarity over speculative positioning
- Explicit policy over implicit behavior

## Legal Notice

Tesseras Labs S.A. is a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Panama.

The company provides technology infrastructure. It does not provide legal, tax, or investment advice.

Availability of products and features may vary by jurisdiction.
