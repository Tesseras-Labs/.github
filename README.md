## What Tesseras Labs Builds

Tesseras Labs develops open infrastructure for compliant real-world assets, including:

- Tokenization standards and smart contracts
- Onchain and offchain orchestration for RWAs
- APIs and developer tooling for issuers and partners
- Reference implementations and experimental prototypes

- ## Open Source & Transparency

Some repositories in this organization are public reference implementations or upstream mirrors.
Others are private and maintained internally as part of Tesseras Labs’ platform operations.

Public repositories are shared for education, interoperability, and ecosystem development.
