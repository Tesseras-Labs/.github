# Tesseras Labs S.A. 🇵🇦
Panama City, Republic of Panama

Compliant infrastructure for real-world asset tokenization and market access.

Tesseras Labs builds **RWADEX.ai**: a platform suite for issuing compliant real-world asset tokens, operating issuer workflows, and enabling compliant discovery, trading, and liquidity access.

We build infrastructure first.  
We do **not** operate funds, provide investment advice, or act as a broker-dealer.

## What We Build
- Ownership-token infrastructure with enforceable transfer policies
- Issuer operations and policy workflow systems
- Market routing and liquidity-access layers
- APIs, developer tooling, and reference implementations

## Who We Serve
- **Issuers** that need to structure, launch, and operate compliant tokenized assets
- **Investors and market participants** seeking compliant market access and portfolio visibility
- **Liquidity and execution partners** providing routing, execution, and market infrastructure

## Product Principles
- Compliance is part of the product, not a wrapper around it
- Self-custody is the default assumption
- Durability over short-term hype
- Clear policy over implicit behavior

## Ecosystem & Collaboration
Public open-source repositories are not yet available.

This organization is intended to become a landing place for:
- Selected reference implementations and interoperability tooling
- Joint technical initiatives with aligned ecosystem partners
- Public-facing artifacts that support transparent market infrastructure

If you are a potential collaborator, infrastructure partner, or institutional integration team, we welcome direct outreach.
