# Tesseras Labs S.A. 🇵🇦
Panama City, Republic of Panama

Compliant infrastructure for real-world asset tokenization and market access.

Tesseras Labs builds **RWADEX.ai**: a platform suite for issuing compliant real-world asset tokens, operating issuer workflows, and enabling compliant discovery, trading, and liquidity access.

We build infrastructure first.  
We do **not** operate funds, provide investment advice, or act as a broker-dealer.

## Who We Serve
- **Issuers** launching and operating compliant tokenized assets
- **Investors and market participants** seeking compliant access and transparency
- **Liquidity and execution partners** supporting routing and market infrastructure

## Product Principles
- Compliance is part of the product, not a wrapper around it
- Self-custody is the default assumption
- Durability over short-term hype
- Clear policy over implicit behavior

## Ecosystem & Collaboration 🤝
Public open-source repositories are not yet available.

This organization is intended to become a landing place for:
- Reference implementations and interoperability tooling
- Joint technical initiatives with ecosystem and institutional partners
- Public artifacts that strengthen transparent market infrastructure

If you are exploring collaboration with Tesseras Labs, we welcome direct outreach.
