# Architecture

## Purpose

Tesseras Labs

## Portfolio role

- Category: Developer experience
- Namespace policy: legacy/external
- Repository: https://github.com/Tesseras-Labs/.github

## Observed baseline signals

- CI workflow present: no
- Test signal present: no
- Detected stack:
- Unknown (developer update required)

## Baseline boundaries

- Define external contracts before internal abstractions.
- Keep state transitions explicit and auditable.
- Prefer additive changes and clear rollback paths.

## Immediate next steps

1. Replace placeholder architecture assumptions with concrete runtime and data-flow diagrams.
2. Document integration contracts and failure modes.
3. Link production runbooks and ownership records once assigned.
